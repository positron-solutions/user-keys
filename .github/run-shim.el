;;; Commentary:

;; This package sets up load paths and then loads the test files and runs
;; commands depending on the command line arguments.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Always get a fresh Emacs for your test runs.  It will reload features and
;; byte compile where necessary.  The Emacs provided by the nix develop shell
;; contains the dependencies declared in the flake.nix.
;;
;;   nix develop .github#

;;   "emacs" --quick --script .github/run-shim.el -- lint
;;   "emacs" --quick --script .github/run-shim.el -- lint-tests

;; Note that this elisp script assumes that some packages are located in
;; specific locations.
