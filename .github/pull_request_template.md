## Pull Requests

Generated changes to the flake.lock should be kept in a separate commit for the
reviewer.  Title your commit as "generated".

Keeping these changes isolated in specific commits makes it much easier to pull
in your changes in parallel with other features.  Maintainers may harvest your
changes.  We only guarantee to preserve authorship, signature, and sign-off in
the git log.
